# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Model
# Overview
This project is a machine learning-based classification model designed to predict whether breast cancer is benign or malignant using a dataset of clinical and diagnostic features. The goal is to provide an accurate, data-driven solution to support medical diagnosis.
# Features
- Predicts whether breast cancer is benign or malignant.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing steps.
- Evaluates model performance with metrics like accuracy.
# Dataset
- Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.
- Description: The dataset contains features extracted from breast cancer cell images, such as:
  - Mean radius
  - Texture
  - Perimeter
  - Area
  - Smoothness, etc.
  - Target: The target variable indicates if the tumor is benign (1) or malignant (0).
# Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
  - Scikit-learn: Machine learning and model evaluation
